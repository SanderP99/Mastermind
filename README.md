# Mastermind
A remake of the game 'mastermind' for the KU Leuven course 'methodiek van de informatica'

A basic implementation of the mastermind game. The MastermindGiven and MastermindTests were given to all the students in the course. The skeleton for the MastermindAsked was also given. I added a few buttons with extra functionality such as a hint and sublist that were not part of the task. I also gave all the buttons their respective color to make the GUI a bit more pretty. The game can be adjusted easily to have more rows and columns. This can all be seen in the images.

# Images
The following images show the GUI of the game. One when the game is started, the other once the game has finished. The pop-up winning message is not shown here.
