# Mastermind
A remake of the game 'mastermind' for the KU Leuven course 'methodiek van de informatica'

A basic implementation of the mastermind game. The MastermindGiven and MastermindTests were given to all the students in the course. The skeleton for the MastermindAsked was also given. I added a few buttons with extra functionality such as a hint that wasn't part of the task. I also gave all the buttons their respective color to make the GUI a bit more pretty.
